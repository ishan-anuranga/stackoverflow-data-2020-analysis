## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

i was interested in finding following using Stackoverflow developer survey:

1. What are the languages most of the users are worked with?
2. What languages users are willing to learn?
3. How many of cloud users are worked with each cloud platform?
4. What cloud platforms are preffered by users who has no recent cloud experience?
5. What are the languages cloud users worked with?
6. What are the languages non-cloud users worked with?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook and 2 csv files. Notebook contains the exploratory analysis of the data and csv files contain the survey data and the schema.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>
